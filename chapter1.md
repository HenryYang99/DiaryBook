# 2018

The year 2017 past so fast before I know it...

Here comes the 2018.

* I hope I can catch every second in my life and plan well in this year.
* I hope I can learn from past mistakes in 2017 so as to avoid falling into the same old trap again.
* I hope I can get a promotion in my coding ability as well as cooking ability.
* I hope I can do a good job in my startups company and reach the target of making a million yuan sales.
* I hope I can grab the opportunity to pursue my lovely and beloved girl,  it's not easy to meet you in such a big world, after all.

_**Life is tough on the whole, but I firmly believe that if we try our best to pursue joys and dreams little by little, life will pay off in the end.**_
