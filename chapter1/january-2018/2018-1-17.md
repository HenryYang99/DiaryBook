Yeah, I have spent the whole day on reviewing my Data Structure' lessons, I'm so tired now...

Tomorrow I will face my last final test in this term and I hope I can get a good score.

After finishing my last test, the 42-year-day winter vocation is waving hands to me.

Wait!!! What did you say? Vocation? As a glory survivor of communism, you shall remove "vocation" this word from your life dictionary. You have undertake the great responsibility for rebuliding the earth great and prosperous again XD.

It's just a joking. But the fact is cruelly quiet familiar... I finish my last test on Jan, 18th. And if it all goes well, I could have gone home next day. Since I have to prepare for my startups company, I shall stay working in Nanjing until Feb, 8th. But I am not alone, I have my excellent cooperators. I firmly believe that we can figure out a good blueprint for our infant enterprise.

That's all...I have no more to say and I have no energy left as well.

I will go to the bed and embrace my warming quilt...May have a tryst with the Duck of Zhou in my sweet dream XD.

Good night, Cheng Xi, may you have a sound sleep. 

Good night, Cheng Xi, I will try my best to protect you in the future.
