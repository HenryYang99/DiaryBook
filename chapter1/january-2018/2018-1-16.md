I am facing the test of Data Structure, and I am little nervous.

Yeah, I reviewed my Data Structure lesson and learned some front-end knowledge such as Bootstrap and javascript in this night. Since the Data Structure's lesson has some many contents and covers a wide range of CS knowledge, there are still many to be reviewed. I got a haircut at Armani\(not that familiar Armani\) Barber Shop, and I swear that it's my last time to patronize it\(though I have swore many times forestall XD\). Yeah, I will share the slides of our Data Structure' lesson. If you take interest in computer science, you can't miss it.
