I am facing the test of Data Structure, and I am little nervous.

Yeah, I reviewed my Data Structure lesson and learned some front-end knowledge such as Bootstrap and Javascript in this night. Since the Data Structure's lesson has some many contents and covers a wide range of CS knowledge, there are still many to be reviewed. I got a haircut at Armani\(not that familiar Armani\) Barber Shop, and I swear that it's my last time to patronize it\(though I have swore many times forestall XD\). Yeah, I will share the slides of our Data Structure' lesson. If you take interest in computer science, you can't miss it.

**Here are the slides of Data Structure, I have put them in my CVM so you can download them for free:**

Additionally, I came across a fancy and extraordinary Chinese poem wrote By 纳兰性德, a famous poet in Qing dynasty.

I'd like to share with you:

### 中文**原版：**

#### 浣溪沙·谁念西风独自凉

【作者】纳兰性德   【朝代】清

谁念西风独自凉？

萧萧黄叶闭疏窗。

沉思往事立残阳。

被酒莫惊春睡重，赌书消得泼茶香。

当时只道是寻常



### 中文翻译**版：**

#### 浣溪沙·谁念西风独自凉

【作者】纳兰性德   【朝代】清

谁念西风独自凉？

`秋风吹冷，孤独的情怀有谁惦念？`

萧萧黄叶闭疏窗。

`看片片黄叶飞舞遮掩了疏窗，`

沉思往事立残阳。

`伫立夕阳下，往事追忆茫茫。`

被酒莫惊春睡重，赌书消得泼茶香。

`酒后小睡，春日好景正长，闺中赌赛，衣襟满带茶香，`

当时只道是寻常。

`昔日平常往事，已不能如愿以偿。`



### 英文翻译**版：**

_Cold on my own in the west wind, dear knows?_

_Incised windows blind by the fall of the rustled leaves,_

_In the setting sun the past to my mind flows._



_Let my cup not to jerk awake her thick Spring sleep,_

_A go of the happy union was not made on nerves._

_Who could only assume that were common shows!_
