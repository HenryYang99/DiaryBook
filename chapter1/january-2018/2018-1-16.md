I am facing the test of Data Structure, and I am little nervous.

Yeah, I reviewed my Data Structure lesson and learned some front-end knowledge such as Bootstrap and Javascript in this night. Since the Data Structure's lesson has some many contents and covers a wide range of CS knowledge, there are still many to be reviewed. I got a haircut at Armani\(not that familiar Armani\) Barber Shop, and I swear that it's my last time to patronize it\(though I have swore many times forestall XD\). Yeah, I will share the slides of our Data Structure' lesson. If you take interest in computer science, you can't miss it.

**Here are the slides of Data Structure, I have put them in my CVM so you can download them for free:**

Additionally, I came across a fancy and extraordinary Chinese poem wrote By 纳兰性德, a famous poet in Qing dynasty.

I'd like to share with you:

### 浣溪沙·谁念西风独自凉

【作者】纳兰性德   【朝代】清

谁念西风独自凉？

萧萧黄叶闭疏窗。

沉思往事立残阳。

被酒莫惊春睡重，赌书消得泼茶香。

当时只道是寻常
