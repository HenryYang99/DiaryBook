Ummm. tomorrow I was too tired to write a diary. So I went to the bed early instead of staying up late to finish my diary. I wrote this diary in 21st's morning.

Today is a bad day. Since I went to sleep too late that I felt tired and exhausted this day. I even can not focus on my work. After  analyzing  my mistakes and making a comprehensive report of my timeline, I decide to adjust my timetable to cater for my work needs.

I don't have many things to note down, and there is no remarkable events today.

Hope you guys a nice day.

Hope my families a good health.

Hope Chen Xi enjoy your vocation.
